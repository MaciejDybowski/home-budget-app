# Example environment variables for local usage
# Copy this file to `.env` in project root and customize.

# Registry host (with port if needed). Replace with your registry host like registry.local:5000
REGISTRY_HOST=localhost:5000

# API URL used by frontend dev server proxy (include http:// and port)
# e.g. http://localhost:3000
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Note: docker-compose supports variable interpolation from .env in the same directory.
# To override REGISTRY_HOST for everyone, update this file or set the env variable in CI.
